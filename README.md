<h1>Introduction</h1>
The Sobel operator performs a 2-D spatial gradient measurement on an image and so emphasizes regions
of high spatial frequency that correspond to edges. Typically it is used to find the approximate absolute
gradient magnitude at each point in an input grayscale image.
<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this project is to experiment the optimization techniques in the context of an image
processing embedded on the board SABER IMX6 (ARM_Cortex-A9, quad-core):
<br>* Algorithmic optimization (algorithm of lower complexity in the mathematical sense, adapted
data structures)
<br>* Optimization for RISC processors
<br>* Optimization for efficient use of hardware resources: data access, cache management, multi-
threading.
<h2>Tools</h2>
Linux OS, Raspberry OS, board SABER IMX6, OpenCV library with C language
